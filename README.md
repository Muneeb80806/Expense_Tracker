Expense Tracker
A modern, single-page web application for tracking personal expenses and claimable items. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a clean interface, data visualization, and local storage persistence, allowing you to manage your finances directly in your browser with no setup required.

‚ú® Features
Dashboard: An at-a-glance overview of key financial metrics, including total spending, monthly expenses, budget status, and visual charts.

Personal Expense Tracking: Log personal expenses by amount, category, description, and date. These expenses are tracked against your monthly budget.

Claimable Expenses: A separate section to manage expenses that need to be claimed (e.g., from an employer). These do not affect your personal budget.

Budget Management: Set a monthly budget and visually track your spending progress. The app highlights your remaining funds and indicates if you're over budget.

Category Management: Create, color-code, and manage custom spending categories.

Data Visualization: Interactive charts (Pie, Line, Bar) powered by Chart.js to help you understand your spending habits by category and over time.

Data Persistence: All your data (expenses, claims, categories, budget) is saved directly in your browser's localStorage, so nothing is lost when you close the tab.

Responsive Design: A clean, dark-mode UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

üöÄ How to Use
This project is a single-file application, which makes it incredibly simple to use.

Save the code as an .html file (e.g., index.html).

Open the file directly in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

That's it! You can start tracking your expenses immediately.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the application.

CSS3: For modern styling, including gradients, flexbox, and grid layouts.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.

Chart.js: A JavaScript library for creating beautiful and responsive charts.

üíæ Data Persistence
This application uses the browser's localStorage API to store all your data.

Privacy: Your financial data is saved only on your computer within the specific browser you are using. It is never sent to any server.

Important: Clearing your browser's cache or site data will permanently delete all your tracked expenses. Data is not synced across different browsers or devices.
